# Takara TLDR - Professional Code Standards

## Code Quality Standards

This application follows enterprise-grade development practices with a focus on maintainability, performance, and clean architecture.

### Package Management

- **Use bun exclusively**: Never use npm, yarn, or pnpm for package management
- **Lock file**: Always commit bun.lock to version control
- **Installation**: Use `bun install` for dependency installation
- **Scripts**: Use `bun dev`, `bun build`, `bun start` for development

### Architecture Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract reusable logic into utility functions and custom hooks
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data fetching, processing, and presentation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and graceful degradation

### Component Structure

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Separate client and server components appropriately
- Maintain single responsibility principle

### Code Style

- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting

### Performance Considerations

- Implement proper memoization where beneficial
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Leverage React Suspense for loading states
- Minimize bundle size through code splitting

### Security Practices

- Sanitize all user input and HTML content
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Apply security headers through middleware

### Testing Approach

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Implement integration tests for API routes
- Use proper error boundaries for component testing
- Maintain high test coverage for critical paths

### Documentation

- Keep README.md updated with setup instructions
- Document complex business logic
- Maintain clear API documentation
- Use inline comments sparingly but effectively

### State Management

- Prefer local state over global state when possible
- Use React Context for theme and authentication state
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Avoid prop drilling through component composition

### Accessibility

- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Maintain semantic HTML structure
- Test with screen readers and assistive technologies

### Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Gracefully handle network failures and edge cases

### Code Organization

- Group related functionality in dedicated directories
- Use barrel exports for clean imports
- Maintain consistent file naming conventions
- Separate business logic from presentation logic

### Performance Monitoring

- Implement proper logging for debugging
- Monitor bundle size and loading performance
- Track user interactions and error rates
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals

### Deployment

- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper build optimization
- Maintain deployment documentation
- Monitor application health and performance

### Maintenance

- Keep dependencies updated and secure
- Regularly review and refactor code
- Maintain consistent code style across the codebase
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
